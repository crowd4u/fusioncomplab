<h2>Objective</h2>

<div>
This page is intended to provide a portal for COVID-19 guidelines in schools all over the world.
Such guidelines are often given in local languages and difficult to be reached by people in other countries.
We start with universities that have iSchools but plan to cover as many universities as possible.
We expect that this portal is useful for a variety of purposes including:
<ul>
<li>to share the guidelines among schools, and
<li>to use them as a resource for research.
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Plan</h2>
<ol>
<li>We first start collecting guidelines and provide them with translations.
<li>Then, we will apply some automatic analysis method and made the results available.
</ol>
